# /types Directory

This directory contains all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

## Purpose
Centralized type definitions for the entire application to ensure type safety and consistency.

## What Goes Here
- Database model types
- API response types
- Component prop types (when shared across multiple components)
- Enum definitions
- Union types
- Utility types

## Guidelines
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use type aliases for unions, intersections, and complex types
- Export all types for use throughout the app
- Keep types organized by domain (e.g., posts, content, campaigns)
- Document complex types with comments
